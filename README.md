# Install-32-bit-Linux-as-the-only-OS-on-Core-Duo-based-Apple-Macs-using-USB
This guide focuses on how you can install Linux of 32 bit architecture on your aging Intel Mac as the only OS, which has the Core Duo 32 bit processor using USB instead of a DVD. With this, you can rejuvenate your old Mac. Do note that in this guide, you are wiping your entire hard drive with OS X, so if you are thinking that if you came to "dual boot" your old Mac with Linux, this guide isn't for you. Proceed with caution!
